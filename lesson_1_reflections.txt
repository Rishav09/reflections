How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in

Future doesn't see the needs of present ,what may be irrelevant today can be the need of tommorow so easy
access to history is important.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
 What value do you think it offers?

 Staging area provides a temporary place in which we can manipulate the changes we can observe to see
 in our project
